# read-my-readme


## Description

This README generator is a command-line app application that accepts user input. While utilizing node, users are prompted for information about their application repository, which is then rendered in the form of a professional README.md with the title of their project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License (including badge), Contributing, Tests, and Questions. When the user answers each prompt, the input is generated onto the README.md file in its respective location on the file.
